"""WebSocket server for the DualSense DJ Controller browser UI.

This module exposes real-time controller state to a React-based browser UI
over a WebSocket connection.  It uses FastAPI as the ASGI framework and
uvicorn as the ASGI server, both running inside the same asyncio event loop
as the rest of the application.

Architecture:
    - ``WebSocketServer`` wraps a ``FastAPI`` app with a single ``/ws``
      WebSocket endpoint and optional static file serving for the compiled UI.
    - A shared ``_connections`` list acts as a broadcast registry.  Every
      connected WebSocket is kept in this list; ``broadcast`` iterates it and
      removes dead connections as they are discovered.
    - State is pushed *server → client* only.  The client never sends messages;
      ``receive_text()`` is used purely as a blocking keep-alive so that the
      server can detect when the browser tab closes or the network drops.

Broadcast pattern:
    The ``broadcast_loop`` in ``main.py`` calls ``broadcast()`` at up to
    60 fps.  ``broadcast`` serialises the state dict to JSON once and fans
    it out to all connections.  Failed sends are collected in a ``dead``
    list and removed after the loop, avoiding mutation of the list while
    iterating over it.

        On connection:

               subsequent ``broadcast`` calls).
            3. Send the current full state immediately so the client has
               something to render before the first broadcast arrives.

        Keep-alive loop:
            The server only sends to clients; it never expects the client to
            send anything meaningful.  ``receive_text()`` is called in a loop
            solely to detect client disconnection: when the browser tab closes

            (typically ``WebSocketDisconnect`` or a starlette ``RuntimeError``)
            which breaks the loop.  Without this loop the coroutine would
            return immediately and the connection handle would be lost.

        Cleanup (``finally``):

            ``broadcast`` calls no longer attempt to write to it.
